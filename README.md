# E_Nose_ML_Project
Machine learning project to create an E-Nose to detect Ethylene and Methane gas. The included notebook displays the process and analysis of regression machine learning models using the "Gas sensor array under dynamic gas mixtures Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Given that the dataset output consisted of two different types of gases, two separate models for each case were developed to classify the presence of each individual gas. The first models that were developed used the cleaned sensor inputs. The training methods utilized to develop the prediction models for this project were Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). To determine the accuracy of the LDA, QDA, and LR models, the data was split into half for training and half for testing. For the RF method, the accuracy was obtained by using a K-fold cross validation with K=3. The resulting accuracy of each of the four models are shown below in Table 1.
